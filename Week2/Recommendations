After studying the situation of taxi companies on the following levels, we found that the yellow cab is better than the pink cab:

The yellow taxi outperforms the pink taxi so as its shown The difference in profits between the Yellow taxi and pink taxi is very huge and obvious.

From what we have seen so far the yellow taxi customers are much more than the pink taxi customers and by gender we can easily notice that the male customers are much more than the female customers in pink and Yellow Taxi.

The dominant age of both taxis customers is between 25-40 ,then follows it customers who are between 40-60 ,comes after that customers between 18-25 and at the end customers who are above 60 except that the numbers of the yellow customers are a lot more.

Yellow cab’s average profit per year is almost four times the average profit per year of the Pink cab.

In big cities Yellow taxi is used much more than pink taxi where pink taxis are barely used but we can see that there is not any difference between the two taxis in small cities where taxis aren’t even used that much !

	Based on the points that I have made above , I would recommend Yellow cab for investment.
